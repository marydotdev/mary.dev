            <span class="font-bold">TLDR;</span> In 2017 I graduated from Fordham University with a BA in New Media & Digital Design, decided I actually wanted to be a doctor, did a post-bac for three years while working as a medical scribe to complete the med school prereqs, finished the post-bac as the pandemic started, was unemployed and got back into web design and programming, took the MCAT and realized I actually don't want to wait another four years (at least) to start my career, and finally decided to pursue a career in technology as per the original plan.

        <p class="text-xl">
            Eventually I want to combine my interests in medicine, technology, and entrepreneurship to start my own biotechnology company. Right now, I want to learn as much as I can from anyone willing to teach me.  
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl">
            I plan to learn more about software engineering and architecture, AI/deep learning, and data science. Currently I'm trying to learn the Python and R programming languages so that I can experiment with bioinformatics.
