My Simple SvelteKit Starter is everything you need to get started building a blog or portfolio with Svelte! Transitioning from writing HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS only to working with frameworks can be initimidating to new developers. It's much easier to start learning when you don't have to rebuild everything from scratch. Working on your own website let's you explore new technologies without worrying so much about getting everything perfect.
