I'm in a perpetual state of redesigning and rebuilding my personal site. Like most developers I enjoy making the blog more than the blogging itself. But this year I'm going to spend more time writing about what I learn.

In this post I'll walk you through how I built the responsive navigation bar on this site, and we'll focus on the mobile UI in particular.

This post is under construction! I am working on it! Check back soon!
