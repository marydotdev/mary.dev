Inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat.

Computer code ultimately compiles down to 0s and 1s. Similarly, genetic code compiles down to As, Cs, Gs, and Ts. The 0s and 1s are unintelligible to humans, even though humans are the ones who write computer code everyday. That's because humans don't manually program the 0s and 1s, they write code in programming languages that serve as an abstraction between the machine code and the human author.
