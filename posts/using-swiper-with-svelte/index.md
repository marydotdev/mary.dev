Swiper is a popular open-source mobile touch slider that makes it easy to create swipe interactions. Swiper integrates seamlessly with Svelte, as well as many other front-end frameworks, making it a versatile API worth checking out.

According to its website, "Swiper is the most modern free mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior." Swiper is compatible with mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps. Its API is straightforward and easy to use, and the documentation is full of specific examples for how to use with vanilla JS, Angular, React, Svelte, and Vue. Check out the [Swiper Svelte docs](https://swiperjs.com/svelte) to get an idea of how the library is structured.
